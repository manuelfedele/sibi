**SIBI** is an XMLRPC interface to Interactive Brokers API.

The main purpose of this library is to transform the `async` threaded world of tws api into `sync` procedures,
(and an `async` redis queue) in order to develop custom applications easily.

It needs TWS **9.76.1** or greater python api to work.
